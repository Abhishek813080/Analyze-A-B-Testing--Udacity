# Project- Analyze A/B Test Results - Udacity

# <b>Summary

We have data of e-commerce website. The company has developed a new page in order to try and increase the number of users. In this A/B testing you have to predict the which page has higher demand and in which country.

# <b>Goal of the Project

Our goal is to work through this dataset to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.



# <b>Technologies Used

1.Pandas<br>

2.Numpy<br>

3.Matplotlib<br>

4.csv<br>

5.Statsmodel<br>

6.Scipy<br>

# Statistical Analysis

<ul>
<li>Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations
<li>Z-core tests
<li>Logistic regression
<li>Multiple linear regression modelling to assess for interactions of independent variables
    

# Practical Analysis

<ul>
<li> After performed probability control and treatment model we didn't get any solid evidence to check which page performed better either old page or new page but if we are considering convertion rate in that old page had highest convertion rate.
<li>In phase - II we performed null hypothesis test in which P-value defined Old page has maximum rate.
<li>In Phase - III We trained our model using logistic regression.Regression model is to predict the depedent value based on independent values. If we add other thinges in our model we can evaluate more factors in regard of our convertaion rate. But, some times increation things in our model will increase the relationship between indepdent variables that will be not a good sign.
<li>In phase - IV we tested this convertion rate on countries like US,UK,CA in that test also old page has highest convertion rate in UK country.    

# Conclusion

We should keep Old page as it's have high convertion rate but in long run new page can increase convertion rate but not now.
